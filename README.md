# Revengine
The Revengine is a custom-built, low-level engine that utilizes C++ for internal/backend programming, and Windows Presentation Framework (WPF) C# for the front-end, Editor programming. The Revengine uses the WPF Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) Pattern to separate Editor UI scripts from their functionalities.
